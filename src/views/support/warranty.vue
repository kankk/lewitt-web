    <h2>2 Year Limited Warranty</h2>
    <p>
      All products manufactured by LEWITT GmbH feature a limited two-year warranty. This two-year warranty is specific to the date of purchase as shown on your purchase receipt.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEWITT GmbH shall satisfy the warranty obligations by remedying any material or manufacturing faults free of charge at LEWITT's discretion either by repair or by exchanging individual parts or the entire appliance. Any defective parts removed from a product during the course of a warranty claim shall become the property of LEWITT GmbH.
    </p>
    <p>
      While under warranty period, defective products may be returned to the authorized LEWITT dealer together with original proof of purchase. To avoid any damages in transit, please use the original packaging if available. Please do not send your product to LEWITT GmbH directly as it will not be serviced. Freight charges have to be covered by the owner of the product.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following cases are not covered by the above warranty:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>minor deviations or faults in the quality of a product which do not affect the product's value or fitness for its intended purpose</li>
      <li>any accessories supplied with the product</li>
      <li>rechargeable and disposable batteries (these products have a shorter service life, the length of which also depends on the frequency of use)</li>
      <li>faults resulting from improper use (e.g. operating errors, mechanical damage, incorrect operating voltage)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Proper use for the purposes of this warranty is defined as use of the product under the conditions stated in the instructions for use.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>faults due to wear and tear</li>
      <li>any modification of LEWITT products effected by you or a third party, unless LEWITT has given its prior written consent to the nature and extent of the modification</li>
    </ul>
