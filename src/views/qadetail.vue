  <h2>How does LCT 550 keep 0 dB (A) self noise？</h2>
  <p>
    The LCT 550 is the first and only large diaphragm studio microphone ever to achieve 0 dB (A) self noise by electronics and circuitry. That makes it possible to capture even the finest nuances and details with highest precision. How does that work?

  <p>
    The capsule with ultra high signal output is one of the key features enabling us to put as little noise as possible to your signal chain. A 3µm Mylar diaphragm sits 30µm above the electrode. The mid centered diaphragm connection allows very high polarization voltages to achieve maximum signal generation.
